## Basic Math


## Loops

1. Write a loop to sum the integers from 1 to 100
1. Write a loop to sum the even numbers from 1 to 50.
1. Write a loop to sum the odd numbers from 1 to 50.
1. 3n+1 conjecture. Read in a positive integer from the keyboard and repeatedly apply the following rule:
  If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
  If the number is even, divide by 2
  Repeat until the number 1 is reached. For example
  n = 5	       	  5  16  8  4  2  1
  n = 30	  15 46  23 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1


## Floating Point

1. Write a loop to compute the floating point sum from 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n, for n=100

Compute the same sum backwards. Print out the difference between the two sums and determine which one is more accurate.

1. Mystery Sum: Compute the sum: $1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ... 1/n^2$.

## Nested Loops

1. Read in a positive integer from the keyboard and print out an n by n multiplication table
1. Read in a positive integer n and find the longest 3n+1 conjecture for every number from 1 up to n.
